# VAT Validation App

This is a VAT validation application
with VAT number checked based off Erply API(Endpoint).
The App also uses the OpenWeatherMap API for 
dynamic city Search. The City Search anables users to
to choose a city in the country where the enterprise is located,
but it's not neccessary to check VAT validation just
for better user experience.

The project was created using [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate). Check it out.
